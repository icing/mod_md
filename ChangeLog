 * renew window taken into account when scheduling md watchdog
 * new directive MDRenewWindow which specifies the number of days (per default) that certificates
   should be renewed before they expire. Can be set globally or directly on a MD.
 * when run as normal user, mod_md can restart httpd after successful staging of new credentials
 * protocol driving split into staging and loading phase. a2md does both, httpd watchdog runs
   staging and on restart the staged changes are loaded.
 * security: store generates on init a master pass phrase. All private keys outside of the "domains"
   storage group are only stored encrypted.
 * filesystem store now with relaxed permissions on challenges

v0.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * new directive "MDDriveMode auto|manual". In "auto" mode (more precisely, if auto mode is enabled
   for any managed domain), mod_md will require mod_watchdog to be present and regularly check
   those domains and attempt to retrieve credentials if some are missing
 * drive mode "auto" lacks still various features, function- and security-wise. tbd.

v0.0.2 - v0.0.9

 * 'make test' now has dependency on all sources being built
 * test cases now use the binary in ./src/a2md instead of the installed one
