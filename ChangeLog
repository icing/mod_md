V2.3.2 (BETA)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Add key usage extensions to fallback certificates; correct other extensions.
 * Correct decoding of IP addresses in certificates.
 * Add contrib directory (not yet shipped).
 * Add SeLinux policy changes necessary for mod_md in contrib/selinux.
 * `MDNotifyCmd` and `MDMessageCmd` now get the environment variable `MD_STORE` containing
    the path to the storage directory.
    Also `MD_VERSION` is added to the environment, containing the version plus an optional
    `-variation`, e.g. `-git` indicator.
 * Added very preliminary (and rough) version of contrib/md_events script.
 * test suite: test of Messages less timing dependant

V2.3.1 (BETA)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The keyname in key and certificate files is now forced lower case.
 * Formatting in 'server-status' page has been improved when showing >1 certificates
 * Fallback certificates (when the domain has none yet) are now generated for all 
   key types requested in MDPrivateKeys of that domain.
 * Update /.httpd/certificate-status to correctly handle multiple keys.

v2.3.0 (BETA)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MDPrivateKeys checks for duplicate key specifications. There can only be one RSA key
   and a curve name can also only appear once.
 * Test case for curve "x25519" is being skipped as this key does not work correctly - yet.
 * Added more EC and dual keys tests. Tests now verify that the correct certificate is
   used when the client is limited in protocol version and ciphers.
 * Tests run with multiple certificates. Certificates are listed in status reports. The
   "server-status" html table gives individual links. Expiry durations are aggregated.
   OCSP stapling picks up the new certificates nicely.
 * The JSON format for reporting certificates changed, not sure if it stays now as it
   is or if there should be come backward compat with 1 cert use.
 * MDPrivateKeys allows the specification of several types. Beside "RSA" plus optional
   key lengths elliptic curves can be configured. Right now, the module only creates a
   certificate for the first key type given.
 * Test cases added for "secp256r1" and "secp384r1" which are supported by Let's Encrypt.

v2.2.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Prefer MDContactEmail directive to ServerAdmin for registration. New directive
   thanks for Timothe Litt (@tlhackque).
 * Distribute a2md.xml and conditionally build it, if xmlto is available. Addition
   by Joe Orton (@notroj).

v2.2.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Michal Karm Babacek (@Karm) added `cmake` support, especially valuable under Windows.
 * protocol check for pre-configured "tls-alpn-01" challenge has been improved. It will now
   check all matching virtual hosts for protocol support. Thanks to @mkauf.

v2.2.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Corrected a check when OCSP stapling was configured for hosts
   where the responsible MDomain is not clear, by Michal Karm Babacek (@Karm).
 * @uhliarik added documentation for the `a2md` command. Use `xmlto man ./a2md.xml` to generate it.
 * Softening the restrictions where mod_md configuration directives may appear. This should
   allow for use in <If> and <Macro> sections. If all possible variations lead to the configuration
   you wanted in the first place, is another matter. 
 
v2.2.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixed a compile time issue with OpenSSL 1.0.2 in the new OCSP code.
 * Skip port checks for domain server_rec selection when "tls-alpn-01" is configured
   explicitly (related to #133). [@mkauf]
 * Added a sample scripts/md_message.sh on how to use `MDMessageCmd`.

v2.2.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Configuring MDCAChallenges replaces any previous existing challenge configuration. It
   had been additive before which was not the intended behaviour. [@mkauf]
 * Fixing order of ACME challenges used when nothing else configured. Code now behaves as
   documented for `MDCAChallenges`. Fixes #156. Thanks again to @mkauf for finding this.
 * Added a script - inspired by curl <https://github.com/curl> - that collects contributors
   from the git commits and PRs. Adding a "Thanks" section with their names in the README.md.

v2.2.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixing a potential, low memory null pointer dereference [thanks to @uhliarik].
 * Fixing an incompatibility with a change in libcurl v7.66.0 that added unwanted
   "transfer-encoding" to POST requests. This failed in directy communication with
   Let's Encrypt boulder server (however it worked when accessed via the hosting CDN,
   as almost all live usages do). Thanks to @mkauf for finding and fixing.
 
v2.2.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixes a compiler warning. False flag, but initialization to make it happy does not hurt.
   Thanks to @sundayoyeniyi for finding this. Refs #154.

v2.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * No longer beta status.
 * Synched with Apache trunk and planned for 2.4.x backport when all works well there.
 * Re-importing of log tags assigned in Apache project.
 * Some documentation clarifications.

v2.1.10
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * if 'MDBaseServer' in enabled and there is no specific VirtualHost for a domain, the
   base server config is considered the relevant one for deciding ACME support. This
   is most relevant for the 'tls-alpn-01' challenge, see issue #150).
 * MDMessageCmd is now invoked with 'installed' when the certificate is actually becoming
   active at server startup/reload. Different to all other messages, this one is invoked
   while the server is still root and has according privileges. (Hint: you may use this
   to copy a certificate+key to another application's preferred location/format.)

v2.1.9
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * server-status no longer leaves the "activity" column empty when a renewal is ongoing.
 * server-status activity: report a renewal as "pending" when it is due but no job has been
   started yet.
 * removed the "valid after" time as this was confusing. The new certificate is already
   valid, only it is recommeneded to wait with the actication a bit. Admins are probably
   better aware what the clock skew requirements of their site are.

v2.1.8
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Some notifications cleanups:
   - notifications about errors no longer change the status of the ongoing renewal.
   - notifications about a successful renewal are re-attempted on failure, just like
     other failures cause a retry with a backing-off delay.
   - warnings about expiring certificates are only sent, if there is no renewal
     already done (but maybe not activated yet) for a domain
   - failure to notify about expiring certficates also cause retry and are cleared
     when/if finally successful.

v2.1.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Changed server-status section headings to make more clear what is listed there.
 * no longer listing the logs in the top-level md-status handler (where all managed 
   domains are listed). Getting the status of a particular domain has the log).
 * fixing some signedness warnings in clang 11.
 * Fixes bug in time period calculation for removing old OCSP response files.

v2.1.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixed issue #145 where a server restart was not done when recommended and checking
   becamed called in a tight loop, eventually calling message commands again and again.
   Test case added for this.
 * 'make test' will now trigger the build if not done before. removed some obsolete
   test special targets.
 * starting to integrate with travis for build and test coverage 
 * documented how MDCAChallenges now overrides any port sanity checks.

v2.1.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * fixed a crash when the server-status page was retrieved in text form (e.g. server-status?auto 
   url) and a MDomain had been renewed. Test case added. Fixes #141.
 * Test suite: rework on how httpd config is set up to allow for MDomain tests that use
   the base server and listen only on one port.

v2.1.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * added test case for #142 and fixed a bug in JSON array handling introduced in 2.1.3

v2.1.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * added more trace2 level logging in server-status collection to help issue #141
 * fixed the status handling to return job information from staging also when the certificate
   is not there yet.
 * fixed a bug in JSON handling that decremented refcounters wrongly when setting another
   JSON object at a key where none was allowed. Added test case.   
 * OCSP Stapling information in "server-status" is now sorted alphabetically.
 * add a CA column to Managed Domains table
 * urls are now displayed as links with the hostname or known name as text.
 * similary to ocsp status, certificate status 'ok' is now 'good'. Will turn to 'expired'
   should the certificate validity pass the current clock.

v2.1.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Refactoring the initialization to distinguish between VirtualHost definitions that have 
   SSLEngine on and those who do not. The advantages are:
   - No MDPortMap definition is necessary to detect where SSL certificates are needed.
   - mod_md will only collect ServerName/ServerAlias from VirtualHosts that use SSL.
   - One can have a 'catch-all' VirtualHost on port 80 using all domains without them 
     bleeding back into the MD definitions.
 * Initialization no longer traverses the complete md store, reads configured MD JSON
   files only once and writes them only when changed. When a new MD is added or
   an existing one renamed (the first domain member changes), will the store be searched
   for old definitions and certificates. This search only looks at MDs outside the current
   set and should remain efficient with many MDs configured.
   Example: if you have 100 MDs and rename 1, mod_md will see the 99 directories that stayed
   and load the one unmatched to check for a rename.
   

v2.1.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixed a bug where the "acme-tls/1" protocol setting was not recognized on the base server
   (with "MDBaseServer on").
 * ACME errors returned during account creation are now added to the job log.
 * A missing ServerAdmin is now properly logged at the renewal job.

v2.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * fixed a crash in "server-status" handler when stapling was enabled but not status information
   could be found.
 * toning down some INFO level logging to DEBUG or lower.
 * new directive 'MDCertificateMonitor' to allow configuration of the check HTML links rendered
   in the server-status page.
 * server-status timestamps now in a better readable format. Some columns have been merged.
 * Much more verbose data logging when OCSP responses could not be parsed.
 * Fixed a bug with suppressing "Expect" header sending.
 * MDMessageCmd is now also invoked for stapling with reasons 'ocsp-renewed' and 'ocsp-errored'.
 * Fixed a bug where notifications about an expiring certificate were sent out too often.
 * "md-status" handler now also adds OCSP stapling logs to the JSON output.
 * Patch files for Apache trunk and 2.4.x branch are now empty. mod_md will work with
   unpatched copies of those.
 * Converted pytest suite from python2 to python3. "make test" now calls "python3 -m pytest".
 * "server-status" page now carries a new table of all OCSP stapling certificates managed
   by mod_md stapling. Shifted ocsp related information in JSON "md-status" around a bit.
 * New directive "MDStaplingRenewWindow" to configure when OCSP response should be renewed.
 * OCSP response cleanup implemented and test case added.
 * bringing over APLOGNO() number assignments from apache subversion tree.
 * fixed a compile error on warn level about redefintion of AP_ENABLE_EXCEPTION_HOOK. Fixes #132.
 * New directive "MDStaplingKeepResponse" for controlling how long OCSP responses are
   kept in the store and older ones get removed at start up.
 * Errors reports by an ACME CA may include "subproblems", where several causes may be reported. 
   These are now part of the md-status reporting and also logged. Test cases added.
 * OCSP status and validity now part of md-status resource.
 * The number of log entries for a single job is now limited to 128. New entries will
   cause the oldest ones to be removed.
 * OCSP Stapling renewal jobs are now also persisted in the store.
 * Fixed a user-after-free when updating accounts from the server.
 * CA reported problems when authorization challenges fail are now visible in the renewal log.
 * backoff timing for failed ocsp retrieval attempts. specific ocsp update will be
   delayed accordingly.
 * ocsp responses up for renewal are checked periodically for updates in the store.
 * ocsp responses are now saved in and retrieved from store. Concurrent access in place, timed
   invalidation handling still missing.
 * first own ocsp test successful.
 * first ocsp responses are retrieved, but the cache does not work cross-process yet.
 * New directives "MDStapling on|off"
 * Overall, connect and stall timeouts set in http client requests.
 * Prepping http client for multi request handling in parallel.
 * Adaptions for new mod_ssl interface via hooks, as available in apache trunk.
 * Fixing NULL dereferences when unable to lead certificate chains from staging.
 * Updating a newly created account in a2md right away to make sure it responds. 

v2.0.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MDs with static certificate (MDCertificateFile) are not auto-renewed. But they are watched
   for expiration and trigger a configured MDMessageCmd.
 * ACME challenge method 'tls-alpn-01' is now checked for each domain in an MD individually
   and no longer needs to be available for all domains.

v2.0.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Renewal jobs now have their own log attached with timestamps when renewal was started,
   ran into errors, finished. The job JSON files are copied from staging into the domain
   directory for possible later review.
 * job logs now list all activities during renewal.
 * new `MDMessageCmd` added as alternative to MDNotifyCmd. This command is called with an
   addition "reason" parameter that specifies what happened to the manged domain. 
 * `MDNotifyCmd` is now called for each domain that has been successfully renewed. Not for 
   all Managed Domains after all have been processed. This gives notifications earlier.
   Notification errors are now also collected under MD status and notifications are retried
   with backoff delays.
 * New directive `MDServerStatus` to control if Managed Domains are listed in Apache's 
  `server-status` handler or not. Default yes.
 * New directive `MDCertificateStatus` to control if JSON certificate information on a domain
   should be made available on https://<domain>/.httpd/certificate-status or not. Default yes.
 * fixed a bug that checked ACMEv2 authorizations against the server several times unnecessarily.

v2.0.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Updated README.md with new directives and howto.
 * New directives "MDCertificateFile" and "MDCertificateKeyFile" that allow defining
   Managed Domains for certificates coming from somewhere else. 
 * "MDRenewMode" is the new name of "MDDriveMode" (which is still available for 
   backward compatibility). This should make it easier to understand what it does.
 * Removing some fields form the store MD JSON, now that we can inspect the pubcert itself
   all the time. Less store updates.
 * Dropped support for the pre-v1.x function that mod_ssl used in ancient patches.
 * public cert chain now gets cached in memory before server drops privileges, so we always
   have access to it. Allowed to drop some pre-computed values such as the SHA256 fingerprint.
 * Adding "<MDomain name>" as a shortcut to "<MDomainSet name>". It just reads that much better.
 * More "how to"s in README.md
 * `MDPortMap` directive now also accepts `http` and `https` as external ports. `http:8888` would 
   mean that http requests from the internet arrive on local port 8888.
 * Started "how to"s in README.md
 * MDRequireHttps handler now runs after mod_ssl, so that it can report SSL errors before.
 * All GET requests against an ACMEv2 endpoint (except directory and nonce retrievals), are
   now made as POST with an empty, JWS signed body. See 
   <https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/acme-v2-scheduled-deprecation-of-unauthenticated-resource-gets/74380>
   for the necessity of this API change at LetsEncrypt.

v2.0.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixed an integer overrun for renewal window configuration on 32bit systems that caused
   renewal windows to drop to 0, e.g. renewal when expired. This only happened when
   MDRenewWindow was explicitly configured.
 * JSON format of /.httpd/certificate-status slightly altered. See README.md for details.
 * ACME errors and problems in challenge selection that point to configuration mistakes
   are now visible in the md-status handler.
 * Testsuite cleanup amd use of new md-status handler to verify progress.
 * IMPORTANT: upgrade behaviour changed. MDs that have not `MDCertificateAuthority` configured
   explicitly all get the new ACMEv2 default endpoint of Let's Encrypt. See README.md chapter
   about upgrading for the background of this.
 * Added chapter about the upcoming end-of-life changes for ACMEv1 at LetsEncrypt.
 * Extracting certificate transparency SCT (the signature from CT logs) from a staged
   certificate and displaying these on /.httpd/certificate-status. A monitoring client 
   may use this to verify the signatures against the CT logs, even though the log may not
   yet show the certificate (maximum merge delay seems to be at 24 hours on most logs). 

v2.0.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixing configuration startup (e.g. dry run) to sync with the store again. This let's
   us find renamed MDs and use its correct paths. With wrong paths, mod_ssl gets unhappy
   and logs errors (see #125).
 * Adding an experimental "check" column to server-status with links to known certificate
   checker sites.
 * Certificate validity now appears as "valid-from"/"valid-until" pair.
 * Adding SHA256 fingerprint to certificate-status for renewed certificate.
 * md-status handler fixed to work on nested path locations as well.

v2.0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * New handler "md-status" that can be configured to return the state of all MDs in JSON format.
 * Append the name or domain of an MD to the "md-status" url path and get the JSON of just
   that MD.

v2.0.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Updating the documentation by pulling the wiki into README.md and making the necessary
   additions and edits.
 * If a MDomain is removed, all its challenge store information is purged as well. Test
   case for that added. Fixes #93
 * The ACMEv2 endpoint of Let's Encrypt is now the default for new MDs. Existing MDs will keep
   their values unless one explicitly configures a 'MDCertificateAuthority'. 
 * Non-HTML format of mod_status now lists number of ok/renew/error/ready MDomains.

v1.99.12
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Status lists private key specification, if different from default RSA(2048).
 * Status shows list of MDs sorted alphabetically.
 * Status now shows message from a failed renewal with information and error code on where/why
   it failed.
 * At startup, an initial ACME parameter check is performed. More details are given when
   ACME challenge methods are unavailable as to the cause. server-status list these per MD.
 * Adding challenge type 'tls-alpn-01' to ACMEv1 as well.
 * server-status columns compressed. Expiry/Valid timestamp given as dates only for better
   readability. Full time as tooltip.
 * Renewal jobs properties are persisted after each run. This preserves status and schedules
   when switching child processes by mod_watchdog. It also allows server-status to provide
   more information about ongoing activities.
 * Cleanup of post config work to make the dry-run phase faster and avoid double loadings
   of MD data from the file system.
 * Splitting out certificate driving in separate source. Logging errors/warnings about
   MDomains that can not be renewed once at post config.

v1.99.11
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Rework of MD's contribution to httpd 'server-status' page. Better formatting, reordering, using
   absolute GMT timestamps.

v1.99.10
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MD status now initialized fully in global list. Fixes new status handler to assess
   things even when running in non-privileged setup where access to file system is no
   longer allowed.

v1.99.9
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A domain that is managed by md now exposes a status resource at /.httpd/certificate-status
   in JSON format. This lists serial number, valid-from, expires and the cert itself in base64url
   encoding. Not highly relevant since the connection exposed the certificate already.
   When a domain certificate has been renewed however, the same properties of the renewed
   cert are available under the field "staging". When the server is restarted and the cert
   is activated, these disappear again. This makes it easy to scan domains for pending
   certificate renewals and also gives information of upcoming certificates right away.
 * Added MD section to Apache's "server-status" page listing all managed domains and their
   settings, renewal status and error count.

v1.99.8
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Merge of changes up to  1.1.19
 * Fix for #117, explicitly set file permissions to work around umask defaults.

v1.99.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fix by @nono303 to fix the Windows build that was broken in the last release.

v1.99.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * When the server is not started by root, the module no longer tries to chown() the
   staging and challenges directories as User and Group directives are ignored. Fixes #115.
 * When a md.json file in the store cannot be parsed, it is ignore and overwritten during
   initial synch at server start. 
 * When migrating from ACMEv1 to ACMEv2 on the same host, the account private key of an
   existing account is reused on registration. Let's Encrypt internally treats this as
   the same account, although it is exposed using different urls. This helps keeping
   the waste of large prime numbers at a manageable level and allows for more useful
   statistics from ACME CAs.

v1.99.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Enhanced checks for wildcard domain names in certificate coverage.
 * ACME authorizations and certificate requests only done for minimal set of domain names,
   e.g. domain covered by a wildcard are left out. LE CA requires this.
 * First successful wildcard certificate signup in test suite
 * Old and long deprecated configuration directives "ManagedDomain(s)" removed.
 * Challenge type 'tls-sni-01' removed as it has been disabled by Let's Encrypt.
 * When the ACME server threw its challenges at us, we selected the first among the 
   configured/supported ones and ran that. When it failed, the whole authorization
   failed until the retry kicked in. Now, on a failed challenge startup, we look for the
   next possible challenge type and try that.
   This allows for challenge types that are configured and maybe supported in general,
   but do not work for all domains. E.g. when we add DNS challenge support, that type
   may only work for a subset of the domains. 
   Instead of putting the burden on the user to configured the MDomains individually 
   correct, the DNS challenge setup can just return APR_ENOTIMPL and another challenge 
   type is used (if available).
 * configure updated to better work with non-standard curl library locations.

v1.99.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * tls-alpn-01 challenge method, when available, is now preferred.
 * configure now checks the libcurl version to be at least 7.50, as does the Apache configure.

v1.99.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * OpenSSL initialization disabled in the module. Leaving that to mod_ssl/APR.
 * mod_ssl trunk patch is now empty, changes have been committed into Apache trunk.
 * ACME order/challenge cleanup now runs immediately after a successful renewal and does
   not wait for a server restart. 

v1.99.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * fixed bug where a new ACME account was created for each new ACME managed domain when the existing
   accounts did not exist or were no longer valid/applicable.

v1.99.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * adding test cases for migrating MDs from ACMEv1 to ACMEv2
 * adding test case for checks that missing "acme-tls/1" protocol config is detected
 * removing version number for local ACME account storage again (added in v1.99.0). An account
   is only suitable for an ACME server if it matches the directory url exactly.
 * export symbols in the module are restricted to reduce size a bit

v1.99.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * EXPERIMENTAL, EARLY support for the ACMEv2 protocol. Not enabled by default, see README.md.
  * mod_md checks for each domain if the 'Protocols' directive allows the 'acme-tls/1' protocol.
    Only then is the challenge method 'tls-alpn-01' enabled for a MD.
  * first successful tls-alpn-01 test
  * test_700 auto tests now working as test_702 for ACMEv2
  * test_600 roundtrip tests now working as test_602 for ACMEv2
  * test_500 drive tests now working as test_502 for ACMEv2
  * More test cases regarding ACMEv2 account handling.
  * Removed "id" field from ACME accounts as redundant. Internal cleanup of account handling.
  * Integrated recent changes from Apache subversion.
  * Starting support for ACMEv2 protocol
  * MDCertificateAgreement has new value 'accepted' instead of the Terms-of-Services URL. This
    avoids confusion and reflects more what ACMEv2 protocol requires. For ACMEv1 servers, the
    correct URL is retrieved from the server's meta data when 'accepted' is configured.
  
v1.1.17
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * fixed several coding bugs in detection of ACME challenge changes, e.g. when the local
    MDomains changed and challenges for others had already been set up. Fixes thanks to
    Michael Kaufmann (@mkauf).
  * added log messages when (supposed) ACME server's answer was not understood (by @mkauf)
  * eliminated some compiler warnings about signedness and unused variables.

v1.1.16
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * When you move the last domain name from an MD to another one, that now empty MD gets moved
    to the store archive. The JSON file will still show the last domain, in case you want
    to ressurect after a (human) configuration error. Fixes PR 62572
    (see <https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=62572>).

v1.1.15
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Using libressl new integration of openssl API functions when available.
  * making some timed wait in test_0700 more robust
  
v1.1.14
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Preventing other modules from messing with challenge repsonses. Fix by @mkauf. Thanks!
  
v1.1.13
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * adding test cases for accessing a variety of paths for http-01 challenges to confirm
    proper http responses (see #92). Reworked handler to fix edge cases discovered.
  * adapted test cases for new ACME boulder versions that shifted ACMEv1 to another port
  * adapted test case domain from the now forbidden example.org to not-forbidden.org

v1.1.12
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * less confusing logging when MDNotifyCmd returns a failure exit code
  * MDNotifyCmd can be configured with arguments to which the managed domain
    names are appended on invocation
  * added more test cases for MDNotifyCmd use

v1.1.11
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * fixes a Null Dereference when specially crafted requests are sent to the server. Reported
    by Daniel Caminada <daniel.caminada@ergon.ch>.

v1.1.10
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * fixes error in renew window calculation that may lead to mod_md running
    watchdog in a tight loop until actual renewal becomes necessary.
  * /.well-known/acme-challenge requests that cannot be answered for hostnames
    outside the configured MDs are free to be answered by other handlers. This allows
    co-existance between mod_md and other ACME clients on the same server (implements PR62189).
    Suggested by Arkadiusz Miskiewicz <arekm@maven.pl>.

v1.1.9
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Removed bould check from configure. Not everone building the module needs it installed. 
   Fixes #76.
 * Tests with boulder now need a later revision >= 2018-01-10 or you will see failures in the
   0800 tests.
 * Updated with log format fixes and copyright ASF insistence from apache httpd trunk
 
v1.1.8
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * new configuration directive "MDBaseServer on|off" to allow/inhibit management of the base
   server domains outside VirtualHosts. By default, this is "off", e.g. mod_md will not manage
   certificates or perform https: redirections on the base server. This follows the 
   principle of least surprise.
 * Fixed gcc warnings.

v1.1.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * MDMustStaple was unable to create the necessary OpenSSL OBJ identifier on some platforms, 
   possibly because this fails if the OID is already configured in ```openssl.cnf```, see
   [here](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/2795).
 * Two memory leaks in cert issuer and alt-names lookup eliminated by Yann Ylavic.
 * Changing MDMustStaple triggers certificate renewal.

v1.1.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixing a bug when code in assert() checks is not executed.

v1.1.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Some attempts at code readability, increased logging level for fallback cert generation that
   was swept under the DEBUG carpet before.
 * More verbosity when *not* handing out certificates, e.g. mod_ssl asks, but mod_md has no
   idea what it is talking about. Some people report misbehaviour here.
 * Re-enabled support for md_get_credentials() function that was used in older mod_ssl
   patch, so that people with old patched servers get a chance to upgrade.
 
v1.1.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * When ACME fails to authenticate your domain, the exact server answer is logged
   as error. This helps to find out the reason for the failed challenge, for example
   when ACME reports a 'Timeout' if it could not reach your server. Implements #70.

v1.1.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixed wrong mem pool use for auto-added server names.
 
v1.1.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The first configuration check was skipping parts that are needed, especially for new
   MDs, and crash if mod_ssl calls back "too early". Reverting that change.

v1.1.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixed backward compaitbility to '<ManagedDomain' configurations, used in pre v1.1.0 versions
   to continue working. Test case added.
 * added httpd version checks to test cases that make use of 2.5.0 mod_ssl features. Tests now
   run clean against a 2.4.30 installation.

v1.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * IMPORTANT: name change in configuration directives. The Apache team decided that the current
   names would confuse you, the users, and asked for a change. The old names are still working
   in this version, so you can safely upgrade. 
   They will give warnings in the log and will disappear in the immediate future.
   * ManagedDomain is now MDomain
   * <ManagedDomain> is now <MDomainSet>
 
v1.0.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * removed old EXPERIMENTAL code for defaulting to Lets Encrypt staging area.
 * acme now follows "up" link headers to retrieve issuer certificate chain. This
   will lead to shorter chains as the "up" links will stop at the cert that browsers
   trust instead of always going to the topmost root. 
   See https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder/issues/3259
 * Fixed a missing argument in a debug log statement.

v1.0.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * fix in configure: checking for the correct arc4random_buf now.

v1.0.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * restricting post_config dry run to be more silent and performing
   only necessary work for mod_ssl to be also happy with the configuration.

v1.0.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * fixed various bugs in persisting job properties, so that status is persisted across
   child process changes and staging is reset on reloads.
 * changed MDCertificateAgreement url checks. As long as the CA reports that the account
   has an agreement, no further checking is done. Existing accounts need no changes when
   a new agreement comes out. This is as Let's Encrypt rolls.

v1.0.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * staging reset on reload also triggered when MDCertificateAgreement was initially missing.

v1.0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * ServerName/Alias names from pure-http: virtual hosts are no longer auto-added to a Managed Domain.
   Fixes issue #57.
 * Error counts of jobs are presisted now. When the server restarts (gracefully) any errored
   staging areas are purged to reset the signup/renewal process. Fixes issue #55

v1.0.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * New directive 'MDNotifyCmd' that will run when Managed Domains have been signed up/renewed. The
   names of the MDs is given as arguments to the command.

v0.9.9
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Protocol driving now *applies* correct server properties for http/https challenge selection, 
   with new test cases (fixes issue #52).

v0.9.8
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Protocol driving now uses correct server properties for http/https challenge selection 
   (refs issue #52).

v0.9.7
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * When building against 2.4.x, one probably needs to configure without ```--enable-werror```,
   since there were some warnings fixed in Apache httpd trunk.
 * Removed obsolete function from interface to mod_ssl. Module now requires at least mod_ssl
   patch v4 in place.
 * Fallback certificates has version set and no longer claims to be a CA. (re issue #32)
 * ```MDRequireHttps``` now happens before any ```Redirect```.
 * added some compiler warning flags and adding casts/eliminating some unused params accordingly

v0.9.6
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * For Managed Domains with 'MDRequireHttps permanent' a HSTS (rfc6797) header is added
   in the response with value 'max-age=15768000', if not already there.

v0.9.5
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * New directive (srly: what do you expect at this point?) "MDMustStaple on|off" to control if
   new certificates are requested with the OCSP Must Staple extension.
 * Known limitation: when the server is configured to ditch and restart child processes, for example
   after a certain number of connections/requests, the mod_md watchdog instance might migrate 
   to a new child process. Since not all its state is persisted, some messages might appear a
   second time in the logs.
 * --with-openssl configure option provided by [caminada](https://github.com/caminada) to
   specify an uncommon location of the lib.
 * --with-jansson configure option provided by [caminada](https://github.com/caminada) to
   specify an uncommon location of the lib.
 * Adding checks when 'MDRequireHttps' is used. It is considered an error when 'MDPortMap 443:-'
   is used - which negates that a https: port exists. Also, a warning is logged if no 
   VirtualHost can be found for a Managed Domain that has port 443 (or the mapped one) in
   its address list.

v0.9.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * New directive 'MDRequireHttps' for redirecting http: traffic to a Managed Domain, permanently
   or temporarily.
 * Fix for using a fallback certificate on initial signup of a Managed Domain. Requires also
   a changed mod_ssl patch (v5) to take effect.

v0.9.3
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Some sanity checks for MDHttpProxy parameter.
 * Rewrote logic to re-schedule MD jobs and announce renewal completion and server restarts. Related
   to issue #42
 * Additional tweaks for libressl support, thanks to @Sp1l 
 * Implemented alternative for OpenSSL ASN1_TIME_diff() helper which is not available in
   libressl. 

v0.9.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixes for conversions in gcc, fixed duration parsing when apr_strtoi64() defaults to 0 on
   not seeing any digit.
 * New config directive 'MDHttpProxy <url>' to specify a HTTP(S) proxy for outgoing connections.
   Supported in a2md with the '--proxy <url>' command line option.
 * Synched mod_ssl patch with Apache subversion again and made v4 of the patch. Only changes
   were in log messages, so no need to repatch existing installations.

v0.9.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * various fixes in MDRenewWindow handling when specifying percent. Serialization changed. If 
   someone already used percent configurations, it is advised to change these to a new value,
   reload and change back to the wanted ones.
 * various fixes in handling of MDPrivateKeys when specifying 2048 bits (the default) explicitly.
 * mod_md version removed from top level md_store.json file. The store has its own format version
   to facilitate upgrades.

v0.9.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Improved interface to mod_ssl for fallback handling. Backward compatible to previous mod_ssl
   patch, but fallbacks will not work.
 * Provide a temporary, self-signed certificate with a speaking command and domain name if we
   have no other cert for a Managed Domain, yet. Refs github issue #32
 * Continue to provide expired or not-completely matching, existing certificate for a Managed
   Domain until the renewal was successful. This is helpful when one adds a DNS name to
   a MD, so the previous domains can be served while a new cert is requested.

v0.8.2
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * All files necessary to run tests are not in the release package.
 * Making "http-01" the preferred challenge type again, as people "tls-sni-01" requires at least
   one working certificate vhost right now - which not everyone has.
 * moved part of the MD sanity checks from post_config to check_config phase, allowing for error
   detection in check-only runs.

v0.8.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * New directive ```MDPrivateKeys``` to specify the type and parameter to private key generation.
   Currently only 'RSA' is supported as type with an option number of bits >= 2048 as parameter.
   Simple test cases for config handling added.
 * Private RSA keys are now generated with 2048 bits by default. Use ```MDPrivateKeys``` for
   higher security. 
 
v0.8.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * IMPORTANT: store format change. The following changes will be made to an existing md store on 
   first start with a new version (be it by mod_md in the server or a run by a new 'a2md'):
      * pkey.pem will be renamed to privkey.pem
      * cert.pem and chain.pem will be concatenated to pubcert.pem. The former files will remain,
        but no longer be used. They will disappear on next renewal.
   ADVICE: If the current store data is vital to you, please make a backup first!

v0.7.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Fixed test case clearing of store to keep key alive, enabling true random store key again.
 * Removed pun "Something, like certbot" from the User-Agent request header. Refs issue #34
 * Cleaned up reporting of missing/mismatched MDCertificateAgreement in the logs. This will
   no longer trigger early retries.
 * badNonce encounters are no longer reported as errors. Retries are attempted now silently.
   Refs issue #35
 * new default MDRenewWindow. Instead of 14 days, the default is now a third before the end of
   the certificates lifetime. For the usual 90 days of Let's Encrypt certificates, this makes
   an effective renewal window of 30 days - as recommended by LE. Refs issue #30
 * Enabled conversion warnings if supported by compiler, eliminated several signed/unsigned
   warnings.

v0.7.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * LIVE: the real Let's Encrypt CA is now live by default! If you need to experiment, configure
``` 
    MDCertificateAuthority https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```    
 * When existing, complete certificates are renewed, the activation of the new ones is
   delayed by 24 hours (or until the existing ones expire, whatever is earlier) to accommodate
   for clients with weird clocks, refs #1. 
 * Fixed store sync when MDCAChallenges was removed again from an MD. 
 * Fixed crash when MD matched the base server, fixes #23
 * Fixed watchgod resetting staging when server processes disappeared (e.g. reached
   max requests or other limits).

v0.6.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * global or inside ManagedDomain, 'MDMembers auto|manual' defines if ServerName and ServerAlias
   names of a VirtualHost are automatically added to the members of a Managed Domain or not.
   Default is 'auto'.
 * staging information, e.g. temp files during ACME protocol runs, gets automatically reset
   when the managed domain changes.
 * when synching new configurations into the store, the list of domain names is now kept
   exactly the same. This allows removal of a member that fails challenges. Before, only
   additions have been stored. Test cases adjusted.
 * Fixed 'uninitialized var use' when logging too new store version, reported in #25

v0.6.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Restructuring of the source tree to something very similar as it will appear in the 
   Apache subversion repository. Will make synching of changes easier.
 * Test of special handling of store archive handling for Windows system. See issue #24.

v0.5.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Documentation on wiki for several use cases, explaining file store layout and security
 * User-Agent now sent to CA.
   Driving from httpd: Apache/rev mod_md/rev (Something, like certbot)
   Driving from a2md:  apachemd/rev mod_md/rev (Something, like certbot)
 * Logging adjusted for more readable INFO level on relevant changes
 * NOTICE level log when new certificate have been obtained and restart is recommended
 * removed code for service restart, should now compile under Win32
 
v0.4.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Various test runs on live server with ACME staging and real service. First green lock
   obtained by mod_md!
 * Various fixes to permission issues on ubuntu setup server (root/www-data users)
 * Fixed defaults for port mapping
 * New 'MDDriveMode always' to acquire certificates for Managed Domains not used in any
   VirtualHost on the server. Fixed test cases for auto drive mode. Refactored some copy+paste
   code in tests.
 * Test cases stop the httpd server less, making better timings and reliability 
 * adding test and fixes for new config directive 'MDCAChallenges' when no configured challenge
   type is supported by the ACME server.

v0.3.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Adding test case coverage for own base64url coder.
 * ACME challenge type "tls-sni-01" supported. Needs new mod_ssl patch 
   (patches/mod_ssl_md-trunk-v2.diff).
 * Merged check based unit test infrastructure by the awesome 
   [Jacob Champion](https://github.com/jchampio) and linked them to standard 'make test'
 * Using ${prefix}/bin/curl if available. Fixed test cases that failed when curl has SNI
   support.
 * added test that resources are served with "503 Service Unavailable" while TLS credentials
   are still incomplete.
 * disabled a pkey encryption check since it did not work as is un *NIX, fixed gcc warning
 * refcount in md_json_seta adjusted, conversion function expected to always auto-give-away
   their references. 
 * fixed refcount bug in md_json_seta() (supposedly, be optimistic for once!)
 * tls-sni-01 challenge cert and key generated, needs to be activated in mod_ssl

v0.2.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * new directive 'MDPortMap nn:mm' to announce on which local port an ACME CA might reach
   the server. This is necessary if you have redirected port 80 and/or 443 on your firefall
   to another port on the server that runs mod_md. Example:
   MDPortMap 80:5002   443:5001
   is a mapping needed for testing with a local boulder instance. If your server uses 80+443
   your need not mess with this.
 * Fixed reporting error when os does not support *nix permission bits in file system
 * MDRenewWindow parsing fixed and setting/update in store added, testcases
 * Challenge data is being removed from store when staging is done
 * configure option '--with-boulder=<url>' to specify the URL of the boulder test host (defaults
   to localhost:4000)
 * Changed default ACME CA url to letsencrypt.org staging environment when in MD_EXPERIMENTAL
   mode, adapted test outcomes to this setting
 * a2md drive command now with same checks on renewal as mod_md. New option --force to
   force a renewal that look unnecessary.
 * renew window taken into account when scheduling md watchdog
 * new directive MDRenewWindow which specifies the number of days (per default) that certificates
   should be renewed before they expire. Can be set globally or directly on a MD.
 * when run as normal user, mod_md can restart httpd after successful staging of new credentials
 * protocol driving split into staging and loading phase. a2md does both, httpd watchdog runs
   staging and on restart the staged changes are loaded.
 * security: store generates on init a master pass phrase. All private keys outside of the "domains"
   storage group are only stored encrypted.
 * filesystem store now with relaxed permissions on challenges

v0.1.0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * new directive "MDDriveMode auto|manual". In "auto" mode (more precisely, if auto mode is enabled
   for any managed domain), mod_md will require mod_watchdog to be present and regularly check
   those domains and attempt to retrieve credentials if some are missing
 * drive mode "auto" lacks still various features, function- and security-wise. tbd.

v0.0.2 - v0.0.9
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * various development steps not recorded here
 
v0.0.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * new command 'acme validate' to check that account is still known to server and key works
 * fixed all current test failures
 * DNS names are checked for valid characters and non-TLD
 * urls are checked to be absolute for the CA
 * 'make test' now has dependency on all sources being built
 * test cases now use the binary in ./src/a2md instead of the installed one
